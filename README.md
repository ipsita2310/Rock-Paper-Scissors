# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic game we all know and love. I created this game as a fun way to practice my programming skills, especially in JavaScript.
To play the game, simply choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will then randomly select its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
Technology I used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript..
I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it! If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
Thank You
